## üìã TODO - BACKLOG

### üî• HIGH PRIORITY - Performance

#### Optimize Audio File Serving
**Current State:** Audio files load from server via `send_data` through Rails on every play
- ‚ùå Downloads entire file through Rails application
- ‚ùå No browser caching
- ‚ùå Re-downloads when seeking in player
- ‚ùå Slow performance

**Needed Changes:**
```ruby
# In AudioFilesController#stems
# Instead of: send_data attachment.download
# Use: redirect_to rails_blob_path(attachment, disposition: "inline")
# Or: url_for(attachment) for signed URL
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Browser caches audio files
- ‚úÖ Supports HTTP byte-range requests (instant seeking)
- ‚úÖ Serves directly from storage (bypasses Rails)
- ‚úÖ Much faster playback experience

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/controllers/audio_files_controller.rb` - Update `stems` action
- Test with large audio files to verify caching works

---

### üé® MEDIUM PRIORITY - UX Enhancements

#### Add Audio Waveform Visualization
- Consider upgrading to WaveSurfer.js for visual waveforms
- Helps users verify separation quality
- Ability to sync multiple players to compare stems at same timestamp
- Click waveform to seek

#### Batch Processing
- Allow uploading multiple files at once
- Queue system for processing
- Bulk download of separated stems

#### User Authentication & File Management
- Add Devise or similar for user accounts
- Each user manages their own audio files
- File organization (folders, tags, search)

#### Export Options
- Support multiple output formats (MP3, FLAC, OGG)
- Quality/bitrate selection
- Zip download of all stems

---

### üîß MEDIUM PRIORITY - Technical Improvements

#### Upgrade to Demucs ML-based Separation
**Current:** Using simple center-channel extraction (demo quality)
**Needed:** Integrate actual Demucs model for professional separation

**Files:**
- `lib/audio_processing/separate_audio.py` - Already exists but not used
- `requirements.txt` - Already has demucs>=4.0.0
- Update `AudioSeparationJob` to use Demucs script instead

**Benefits:**
- Professional-quality stem separation
- Support for 4-stem separation (vocals, drums, bass, other)
- Industry-standard results

#### Better Error Handling & Logging
- Add error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar, etc.)
- Better user-facing error messages
- Retry failed jobs with exponential backoff
- Email notifications for failed jobs

#### Progress Accuracy
- Current progress is simulated in Python script
- Use actual Demucs progress callbacks if available
- Show estimated time remaining

---

### üêõ LOW PRIORITY - Polish & Nice-to-Haves

#### Audio Player Enhancements
- Keyboard shortcuts (space = play/pause, arrows = seek)
- Remember volume preference (localStorage)
- A/B comparison mode (play vocals+music simultaneously)
- Equalizer visualization

#### Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly UI improvements
- Responsive player controls
- Mobile upload from camera/mic

#### Accessibility
- Better screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation improvements
- ARIA labels for all interactive elements

#### Analytics
- Track usage metrics (uploads, downloads, play counts)
- Popular file types/sizes
- Processing time statistics

---

### üì¶ FUTURE FEATURES

#### Advanced Separation Options
- Custom separation models
- Separation quality settings (fast vs. high quality)
- Isolation strength controls
- Multiple separation types per file

#### Collaboration
- Share separation results via link
- Collaborate on projects
- Comments on stems

#### API
- REST API for programmatic access
- Webhooks for job completion
- API key management

#### Integrations
- DAW plugin integration
- Cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive)
- Streaming service integration

## üìù NOTES

### Current Architecture
- **Rails 8** with PostgreSQL
- **Sidekiq** for background jobs
- **Active Storage** for file management
- **Python** (librosa/soundfile) for audio processing
- **Plyr** for audio playback
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Hotwire** (Turbo + Stimulus) for interactivity

### Key Files
- Models: `app/models/audio_file.rb`, `app/models/separation_job.rb`
- Jobs: `app/jobs/audio_separation_job.rb`
- Python: `lib/audio_processing/simple_separate.py`, `lib/audio_processing/separate_audio.py`
- Controllers: `app/controllers/audio_files_controller.rb`
- Views: `app/views/audio_files/`
- Stimulus: `app/javascript/controllers/audio_player_controller.js`

### Known Issues
- Python script uses basic center-channel extraction (not production quality)
- Audio files load through Rails (performance issue)
- No user authentication
- No file size limits enforced at storage level
- Redis dump.rdb being tracked (added to gitignore)

### Environment Setup
- Ruby 3.3+
- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis (for Sidekiq)
- FFmpeg (for audio processing)

---

## üéØ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. **Fix audio file serving** - Use Active Storage URLs instead of send_data
2. **Test with real audio file** - Upload and process actual song
3. **Consider Demucs upgrade** - For production-quality separation
4. **Add user authentication** - If planning to deploy
