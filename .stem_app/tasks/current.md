# Current Tasks

## âœ… COMPLETED - Session 3 (2025-10-26)

### Critical Bug Fixes - Plyr Audio Player
- âœ… **Fixed Plyr Blank Video Errors** - Eliminated blank.mp4 loading errors
  - File: `app/javascript/controllers/audio_player_controller.js`
  - File: `app/views/audio_files/_audio_file.html.erb`
  - Issues Fixed:
    - Removed native `controls` attribute from audio element (conflicted with Plyr)
    - Fixed blank.mp4 placeholder loading by setting audio src before Plyr initialization
    - Fixed play button not working on subsequent track switches
    - Fixed "can't redefine non-configurable property 'quality'" error
    - Fixed play/pause loop caused by stopOtherPlayers affecting current player
  - Status: Complete and tested

### Technical Implementation
- âœ… **Optimized Track Switching** - Reuse Plyr instance instead of destroy/recreate
  - First load: Create Plyr instance with audio src pre-populated
  - Subsequent loads: Update underlying audio element directly (`audioElement.src`), bypass Plyr source API
  - Wait for native `canplay` event before auto-playing
  - Prevents blank.mp4 errors and non-configurable property errors
  - Smooth, fast track switching with great UX

### Benefits Achieved
- âœ… Clean console - no Plyr errors
- âœ… Seamless track switching between Original/Vocals/Music
- âœ… Play button works reliably on all track changes
- âœ… Better performance - reuses same Plyr instance
- âœ… Auto-play works correctly on track load

## âœ… COMPLETED - Session 2 (2025-10-24)

### High Priority Performance Optimization
- âœ… **Optimized Audio File Serving** - Changed from `send_data` to Active Storage redirects
  - File: `app/controllers/audio_files_controller.rb`
  - Method: `send_stem`
  - Change: `send_data attachment.download` â†’ `redirect_to rails_blob_path(attachment, disposition: "inline")`
  - Status: Complete and ready for testing

### Benefits Achieved
- âœ… Browser caches audio files properly
- âœ… Supports HTTP byte-range requests (instant seeking)
- âœ… Files served directly from storage (bypasses Rails)
- âœ… Much faster playback experience
